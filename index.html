        <p>I'm a middle child of 5 kids, my brother is the oldest and I have 3 sisters. I have lived in Lenexa, nearly
          my whole life. I have a dog named Chloe, she's a Husky Lab mix. I've grown up around computers and they are my
          most favorite passtime.</p>

        <p>I enjoy playing sports of all kinds, however, bowling is my favorite. I have worked on cars, in construction,
          home remodeling, programming, accounting and making websites!</p>

        <p>I'm currently enrolled in two schools Johnson County Community College as a full time student working towards
          my AAS in Computer Information Systems and at the University of Kansas in a Full Stack Web development
          bootcamp.</p>
